The purpose of this repository is to showcase different common use
cases of CircleCI config. All example configuration files are heavily
annotated.

Configs are also validated by CircleCI, so that each example presents a
valid starting point for your own config. For that reason there is
often a horizontal line included which separates the interesting parts
from the rest required to complete a valid config.
